# ALKANES-RS Progress

## What Works

Based on the existing codebase and documentation, the following components appear to be functional:

1. **Core Protocol Implementation**:
   - Block processing and indexing through the METASHREW stack
   - Message extraction and validation for ALKANES protocol messages
   - WebAssembly-based smart contract execution with fuel metering
   - Storage and state management for contract data

2. **Standard Library Contracts**:
   - Authentication token (alkanes-std-auth-token): Provides access control mechanisms
   - Genesis contracts (alkanes-std-genesis-alkane): Network-specific initialization
   - Owned token (alkanes-std-owned-token): Token implementation with ownership verification
   - Proxy contract (alkanes-std-proxy): Contract delegation and upgradeability
   - Upgradeable contract (alkanes-std-upgradeable): Support for contract upgrades
   - Merkle distributor (alkanes-std-merkle-distributor): Token distribution mechanism
   - Orbital functionality (alkanes-std-orbital): Additional protocol features

3. **View Functions**:
   - protorunes_by_address: Returns all protorunes held by a specific address
   - runes_by_address: Returns all runes held by a specific address
   - protorunes_by_outpoint: Returns protorune balances for a specific outpoint

4. **Multi-Network Support**:
   - Bitcoin mainnet, testnet, and regtest
   - Dogecoin
   - Luckycoin
   - Bellscoin
   - Fractal

5. **Development Tools**:
   - Build system for compiling contracts to WebAssembly
   - Testing framework for unit and integration tests
   - Protocol buffer code generation for message serialization

## What's Left to Build

Based on the project structure and documentation, the following components may still need development or enhancement:

1. **Advanced DeFi Primitives**:
   - Lending and borrowing protocols
   - Staking and yield farming mechanisms
   - Derivatives and synthetic assets
   - Governance mechanisms
   - Cross-chain bridges or interoperability

2. **Developer Experience**:
   - Comprehensive documentation and examples
   - CLI tools for contract deployment and interaction
   - Client libraries for different languages
   - Development environments and templates
   - Visual tools for contract design and testing

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - State access pattern improvements
   - WASM execution efficiency enhancements
   - Memory usage reduction
   - Indexing speed improvements
   - Caching strategies for frequently accessed data

4. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Formal verification of critical contracts
   - Security audit implementation
   - Vulnerability testing framework
   - Monitoring and alerting systems
   - Emergency response procedures

5. **Ecosystem Development**:
   - Community building and governance
   - Integration with existing Bitcoin tools and services
   - Educational resources and tutorials
   - Grants and incentives for developers
   - Partnerships with other projects

## Current Status

The project appears to have a solid foundation with the core protocol implementation and several standard library contracts in place. The system supports multiple networks and provides the basic infrastructure for DeFi applications on Bitcoin.

### Key Milestones Achieved:

1. **Core Protocol Implementation**: The foundational components of the ALKANES metaprotocol have been implemented.
2. **Standard Library Contracts**: Several standard contracts have been implemented for common use cases.
3. **Multi-Network Support**: The system supports multiple Bitcoin-based networks.
4. **View Functions**: Basic query functionality is in place for accessing protocol state.
5. **Development Tools**: Build system and testing framework are operational.

### In Progress:

1. **Advanced DeFi Primitives**: Development of more sophisticated financial instruments.
2. **Developer Experience**: Improving tools and documentation for developers.
3. **Performance Optimizations**: Enhancing system efficiency and scalability.
4. **Security Enhancements**: Strengthening the security posture of the system.
5. **Ecosystem Development**: Building a community and integrations with other projects.

## Known Issues

Based on the documentation, the following issues or challenges may exist:

1. **Table Consistency**: Double indexing (calling `index_block` multiple times for the same block) can lead to inconsistent state between tables, causing:
   - Additional tokens to be created with unexpected IDs
   - Balances to be swapped or duplicated
   - Inconsistent state between different tables

2. **View Function Dependencies**: View functions like `protorunes_by_address` depend on multiple tables being properly populated, which requires careful testing and validation.

3. **Cross-Network Compatibility**: Supporting multiple networks with different address formats, block structures, and activation heights requires careful handling of network-specific parameters.

4. **WebAssembly Limitations**: Smart contracts must operate within WebAssembly constraints, including limited memory model, no direct system access, and limited floating-point precision.

5. **Indexer Performance**: As the blockchain grows, the indexer must efficiently process increasing amounts of data while maintaining state consistency and providing responsive queries.

## Recently Fixed Issues

1. **Fuel Refunding**: Fixed an issue in the fuel management system where the fuel refunded to the block was the entire initially allocated amount rather than the actual remaining fuel leftover from running the transaction. The fix ensures:
   - Only the actual remaining fuel is refunded to the block
   - Proper fuel tracking during transaction execution
   - Consistent error handling in fuel consumption
   - No incorrect fuel deductions in error cases

## Next Development Priorities

Based on the current status, the following priorities may be considered for the next development phase:

1. **Expand DeFi Capabilities**: Implement additional financial primitives to enable more sophisticated DeFi applications.

2. **Improve Developer Tooling**: Enhance the developer experience with better documentation, examples, and tools.

3. **Optimize Performance**: Address performance bottlenecks in state access, WASM execution, and indexing.

4. **Strengthen Security**: Conduct security audits and implement formal verification for critical contracts.

5. **Build Community**: Develop educational resources, tutorials, and incentives to grow the developer community.
